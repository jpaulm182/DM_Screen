The spell panel was fixed by addressing several key layout and initialization issues:
First, we identified that the main problem was a layout conflict where both the BasePanel class and the SpellReferencePanel were trying to create and set their own layouts.
We modified the BasePanel class to stop automatically creating layouts in its init method, preventing layout conflicts with derived classes.
For the SpellReferencePanel, we changed how the layout is created by:
Using QVBoxLayout(self) instead of QVBoxLayout() to create the layout directly on the widget
Removing the redundant self.setLayout(main_layout) call since the parent is already specified
Moving the initialization of data before the UI creation
We ensured that the panel always initializes class attributes before trying to use them, preventing "object has no attribute" errors.
